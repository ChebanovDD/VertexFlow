## About

Vertex Flow is designed to speed up your building information modeling (BIM) workflows. No longer necessary to juggle multiple tools and take dozens of steps to prepare and optimize BIM data for creating 3D experiences.

**Vertex Flow SDK** can help you create real-time BIM applications by building on top of any 3D engine.

## How It Works

Vertex Flow makes the process of bringing Revit models into real-time 3D extremely simple by unlocking the ability to stream data directly into your application.

> The first integration is with Revit, but you can integrate with any Autodesk products, as well as other industry tools.
